# Mednet
## Group project for an web application using HTML, CSS, Python Flask
- Collaborated with Casey Olsen and Saahiti Jasti
- Attached the Hi-Fi Prototype files(fig & pdf) in the folder
### To start the app run:

```
export FLASK_APP=server.py
set FLASK_APP=server.py
flask run
```

I also had to disable the cache in my chrome browser to work on styling.
